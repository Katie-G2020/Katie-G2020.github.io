	What is coffee?
</p>

<p	id="navigation">

    Coffee is a brewed drink obtained by extracting in water the soluble components from the roasted pits of the coffee cherry. Coffee is a beverage with a variable percentage of caffeine, and a specific aroma and taste.
    The aroma and taste vary with the Coffea genus, the extraction method, the quality of the coffee beans, and the concentration of the final beverage. The extraction methods are loosely split into two categories: cold extraction or cold brew, and hot extraction, which includes low-pressure extraction, and high-pressure extraction, in the case of espresso.
